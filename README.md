My first project ==> Landing page

First download Starter code from udacity [repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page).

Second I linked the three files together (index.html & styles.css &app.js)

- use css to style the 5 sections
- bulid the navbar
- Extract the data-nav value from the section and store it in variable
- Extract IdAttribute value from the section and store it in variable
- Add new li & newlink
- search for what i need from these sourses :
  https://www.w3schools.com/
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
  https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/javascript-tutorial/

and the rest we saw in the code .....

This project has the scope of converting a static web page into a single interactive page.

It uses javascript to dynamically create navbar links based on the content, when a section is in the viewport it shows the active state of that section.

In this project
5 sections have been added to the page.

Styling has been added for active states.

When we saw , it is clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page
And When we clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scroll to the appropriate section.
And All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
